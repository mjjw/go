    "Go programming language provides a data structure called the array, which can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.\n",

    "Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. A specific element in an array is accessed by an index.\n",

    "var variable_name [SIZE] variable_type\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a single-dimensional array. The arraySize must be an integer constant greater than zero and type can be any valid Go data type. For example, to declare a 10-element array called balance of type float32, use this statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "var balance [10] float32\n",
    "\n",
    "Now balance is avariable array which is sufficient to hold upto 10 float numbers.\n",

    "Initializing Arrays\n",

    "You can initialize array in Go either one by one or using a single statement as follows:\n",

    "The number of values between braces { } can not be larger than the number of elements that we declare for the array between square brackets [ ].\n",
    "\n",
    "If you omit the size of the array, an array just big enough to hold the initialization is created. Therefore, if you write:\n",
    "\n",
    "var balance = []float32{1000.0, 2.0, 3.4, 7.0, 50.0}\n",
    "\n",
    "You will create exactly the same array as you did in the previous example. Following is an example to assign a single element of the array:\n",
    "\n",
    "balance[4] = 50.0\n",
    "\n",
    "The above statement assigns element number 5th in the array with a value of 50.0. All arrays have 0 as the index of their first element which is also called base index and last index of an array will be total size of the array minus 1. Following is the pictorial representation of the same array we discussed above:\n",
